# DHCP-Server-which-can-serve-multiple-Vlans
### Task
Implement Router as a DHCP server that can serve multiple VLAN's

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 

DHCP is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, thus allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP.

##### Advantages of DHCP are:
1. Reliable IP address configuration. 
2. Reduced network administration. 
3. Centralized and automated TCP/IP configuration.
4. The ability to define TCP/IP configurations from a central location
5. The efficient handling of IP address changes for clients that must be updated frequently
